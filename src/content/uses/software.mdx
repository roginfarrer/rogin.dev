## Editor & Terminal

I spend most of my time coding with the [Kitty][kitty] terminal with the [Fish][fish] shell and editing code with [Neovim][neovim]. I relatively recently adopted [tmux][tmux] for being able to swap instantly between workspaces. This was a multi-tasking game-changer for me, as it let me pause work on one project and move to another one without disrupting my work on the former.

In terms of look-and-feel, I primarily use the [catppuccin][catppuccin] theme and the [Zed Mono](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed-fonts) font. (Although I'm using a custom build of the font, which can be found [here in my dotfiles repo.](https://github.com/roginfarrer/dotfiles/tree/main/fonts/zed-mono))

While I've tried to use pre-configured distributions of Neovim, like LazyVim, I always come back to my own configuration. A lot of it takes inspiration from other distrubtions or configurations, but I like to be able to see how everything fits together.

[Fish][fish] is my shell of choice. I prefer it mainly because of the headache of configuring the other ones. That said, I find managing the PATH variables to be a headache with Fish. You can't have it all, I suppose!

## Productivity

I'm always trying new task management apps, but [Todoist][todoist] is always my default. I've never been completely satisfied with it, though. While it has almost every feature I could need, I find that I'm constantly feeling disorganized with it. It's probably a symptom of how I use it. But I've never "figured it out". Regardless, it's my default inbox for ideas and todos.
